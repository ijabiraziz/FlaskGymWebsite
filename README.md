# FlaskGymWebsite
I have created one-page website for GYM Using web-technologies (HTML+CSS and JavaScript) for frontend and a python based 
micro web-framework FLASK for backend.

A User can register himself/herself using this webpage from anywhere.
All user need is to go to registration form and fill all the required field.

All the information about user will be store in a database.

In this web application i have included SQLAlchemy which is basically ORM and 
makes it super easy and comfortable for python programmers to work with the databases.
Each time user searchs for a country or city weather, it will be store in database and 
when by clicking the cross sign on top right corner, that city or country name will
be deleted from the database.

Thanks!
